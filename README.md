Calibrated_Bluetooth_Joystick
=============================

The second of two Arduino scripts needed to make a very simple Bluetooth joystick. This script includes the capability for joystick calibration. Calculated calibration values are saved to the Arduino micro-controllers EEPROM so that they can be automatically retrieved next time the hardware is connected.
